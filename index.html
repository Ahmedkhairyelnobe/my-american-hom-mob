                        <p>For years, I quietly blamed and resented my daughter for my bulging waistline.</p>
                        <p>I know how bad it sounds, but my stomach remained <strong> flabby and round </strong> for
                            THREE
                            DECADES after giving
                            birth.</p>

                        <p>I tried spending all my time in the gym and cutting out all the foods I enjoy. Despite my
                            efforts, I
                            only managed to shed a pound or two occasionally. And unfortunately, <strong> I always ended
                                up
                                adding back
                                what I lost and more. I tried out countless weight-loss programs, but none of them
                                worked
                                for
                                me!</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Did it help that I was under an <strong> incredible amount of stress</strong> attempting to
                            balance
                            motherhood,
                            homemaking, staying fit (HA!), and chasing a career all at once? <strong>Absolutely not!
                            </strong>
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        I guess it's not surprising that <strong>intimacy with my husband disappeared.</strong> And I
                        always
                        saw him <strong>gazing at younger women</strong> ...even after all that I had done for him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was <strong>sacrificing everything</strong> in an attempt to become a <strong>"perfect
                            mom"</strong>...until one day,
                        I looked in the mirror and found that I was <strong>far from perfect.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>I was tired, dumpy, frumpy and constantly irritable... I realized it was <strong>time for a
                            change.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Also, it needed to <strong>fit into to MY own schedule.</strong> I couldn't magically create
                        extra
                        time in my day.
                        So I turned to the internet to search for a <strong>quicker and simpler solution.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then one evening I had my <strong>"Aha! Moment"</strong> when my friend showed me a video
                        detailing
                        the <strong>"Coffee Loophole"</strong>
                        that I now use today! She had achieved <strong>remarkable results</strong> that I couldn't
                        believe.
                        <strong>Despite my doubts, I took
                            a leap of faith due to my health struggles. And Thank God that I did!!!</strong>
                    </p>

                            As it turns out, my problems had <strong>NOTHING to do with my my diet, genetics, or
                                physical
                                activity.</strong>
                            The REAL issue - toxins in the environment that simply "drip away" with this coffee
                            loophole.
                        </p>

                            After spending 30 years at a weight of 214, I am <strong>thrilled to have returned to
                                129.</strong>
                            I was so happy that I even passed on my <strong>"Coffee Loophole"</strong> to my daughter.
                            With this she was able to <strong>"recover"</strong> from her 3rd pregnancy in her mid 30s
                            in
                            <strong>less than a year!</strong>

                        Oh, and I am pleased to say that my husband has finally started paying attention to me and
                        keeping
                        his gaze on me. There is more I could share about this, but I will refrain from doing so ;)
